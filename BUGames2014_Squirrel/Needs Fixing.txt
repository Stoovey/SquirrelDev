Collision handling in ActionState, the way Collisons:: function signatures

Every 'actor' to inherit the same base position / size data class and use no other data for this

CheckHasAnyoneWon to go to CM from ActionState

The way player attacks are handled

'Services', should simplify state ctors much, also cut SDL_Renderer member vars in states
put a config class with win height etc in there

The way RemoveAllStates can't delete them all them return control to a deleted caller

The wasy menustate exits the program

The way the goal is spawned

Acorn spawn used hardcoded screen size

InputManager, the "if not valid pad Id..." should throw? not return false / Vec2()?

InputManager, IsPlayerPadActive() - is that working right?
